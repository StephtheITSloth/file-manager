This is the *File Manager* project I made myself.

How to use:

<p>clone repo</p>
<p>run python freeze > requirements.txt</p>
<p>cd to task dir</p>
<p>run python manager.py</p>


<p>We bet you know how to rename, copy, and delete files on your computer, but have you ever considered creating your file manager? This project will help you do just that. You can guide your file helper through folders, check sizes, and edit content. It's a must-have tool for organizing your computer.</p>
